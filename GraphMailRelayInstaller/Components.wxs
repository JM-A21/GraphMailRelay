		Would prefer most of this be dynamically built directly from project output using Heat harvesting, but while ProjectHarvest or
		DirectoryHarvest tasks in the .wixproj would enable this, there isn't an easy way I can see (short of using a .XSLT transform)
		to inject the ServceInstall/util:ServiceConfig/ServiceControl elements into the generated component for the relay's executable.
		
		However, since the Publish operation in Visual Studio can be configured to pack all necessary binaries into a single executable,
		manually configuring file handling here will work for the time being. As v4 of the WiX toolset matures, we may look at swapping
		this back to a more dynamic setup.
